**Animations**

For both the forest fires (Problem1.dir/) and the epidemic spreading 
(Problem2.dir/), aminations were generated. The simple idea behind the 
animations is to export every time step of a simulation to a .png image (using 
the library TinyPNGOut) and to assemble these images to a video afterwards 
(using e.g. ffmpeg). Some example video files are found in the directories 
´Problem1.dir/fire/´ and ´Problem2.dir/img/´. These directories also contain a 
simple script that creates animations from images.
